    "### Action selection\n",
    "\n",
    "At each step of a reinforcement learning episode, the agent has to select its next action. In order to do this, it usually computes a Q table of state-action values. When *exploiting*, it takes the best action in the current state according to the Q table. This is the greedy method. When *exploring*, it has to do something else to avoid being stuck in a local optimum. This is why other action selection methods exist, like $\\epsilon$-greedy and softmax. \n",
    "\n",
    "When following an $\\epsilon$-greedy behaviour, the agent selects the action with the highest state-action value most of the time (exploitation) and, with probability $\\epsilon$, it performs an action drawn randomly, uniformly and independently from the state-action values estimates (exploration).\n",
    "\n",
    "One drawback of the $\\epsilon$-greedy selection is that the state values do not matter when exploring, as the agent chooses equally among all actions. The softmax rule solves this problem by setting the probability of each action according to the Q table. There are many softmax rules, the most used one relies on Gibbs distribution:\n",
    "$$\\displaystyle \\pi^{(t)}(u|x) = \\frac {\\exp(\\frac{Q^{(t)}(x,u)}{\\tau})}{\\sum_{v \\in V}\\exp(\\frac{Q^{(t)}(x,v)}{\\tau})},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\tau$ is a positive parameter called temperature. The higher the temperature, the closer the choice to equiprobability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignments of the labs rely on the softmax rule defined below. You can add a code for the $\\epsilon$-greedy method and use it instead of the softmax, then analyze your results."
