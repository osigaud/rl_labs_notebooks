    "This is a set of basic reinforcement learning (RL) labs based on jupyter notebooks. The idea is to convey a set of basic reinforcement learning concepts through coding in python and experimentation with graphical displays. \n",
    "\n",
    "The labs are intended for being available to anyone through internet, so the assignments can be followed in full autonomy. If your are following these labs on your own through internet, you can obviously skip whatever you are not interested into, but grossly following the order of exercises below is strongly suggested as some concepts and skills are introduced incrementally. If your are following these labs in the context of a class, well, just do whatever the teacher is asking ;)\n",

Sutton and Andrew G. Barto (1998), The MIT press. \n",

It is defined by a tuple $(S, A, P, r, \\gamma)$ where $S$ is the state space, $A$ the action space, $P(state_t, action_t, state_{t+1})$ the transition function, $r(state_t, action_t)$ the reward function and $\\gamma \\in [0, 1]$ the discount factor.\n",

    "# 2. Dynamic Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming algorithms are designed to work in an MDP which is given to the agent. They find the optimal policy by computing a value function V or an action-value function Q over the state space or state-action space of the given MDP. Value iteration and policy iteration are two standard dynamic programming algorithms which work in a quite different way. You should study both of them using both the value and the action-value function, as these algorithms contain the basic building blocks for Q-learning, SARSA and actor-critic algorithms, as well as model-based methods.\n",

    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Learning is about finding the optimal policy in an MDP when the MDP is initially unknown to the agent. Generally speaking, the agent has to *explore* the MDP to figure out which action in which state leads to which other state and reward. The model-free case is about finding this optimal policy just through very local updates, without storing any information about previous interactions with the environment. Principles of these local updates can already be found in the Temporal Difference (TD) algorithm, which iteratively computes optimal values for all state using local updates.\n",

    "The most widely used model-free RL algorithms are Q-learning, SARSA and actor-critic algorithms.\n",

To obtain an optimal policy in an MDP that you don't know, you may explore this MDP while building a model of its transition and its reward function, and then apply dynamic programming on this model. Actually, you can learn the model simultaneously with applying dynamic programming, but this may raise convergence issue.\n",

It has good properties in the continuous action domain, hence it played a key role in the advent of deep RL with continuous actions.\n",
